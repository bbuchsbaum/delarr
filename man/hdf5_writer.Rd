\title{HDF5 writer for streaming \code{collect()}}
\usage{
hdf5_writer(path, dataset, ncol, chunk = c(128L, 4096L), compression = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the HDF5 file. The file is created if it does not exist.}

\item{dataset}{Name of the dataset to create or update.}

\item{ncol}{Total number of columns that will be written. The writer uses
this to size the target dataset up-front.}

\item{chunk}{Integer vector of length two giving the chunk size
\verb{(rows, cols)} for the target dataset (optional).}

\item{compression}{Compression level passed to \code{hdf5r} (currently unused but
kept for forward compatibility).}
}
\value{
A writer object with \verb{$write()} and \verb{$finalize()} methods understood
by \code{collect()}.
}
\description{
Creates or extends an HDF5 dataset so that \code{collect(x, into = writer)} can
stream column blocks directly to disk without materialising the full matrix
in memory.
}
