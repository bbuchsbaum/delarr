\title{Materialise a delayed matrix}
\usage{
collect(x, into = NULL, chunk_size = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{delarr} object.}

\item{into}{Optional writer or callback used to receive streamed chunks.}

\item{chunk_size}{Optional column chunk size; defaults to seed hints or
16384.}
}
\value{
A realised matrix/vector, or \code{NULL} invisibly when writing to
\code{into}.
}
\description{
Streams column chunks from the backing seed, applying deferred operations
and optional reductions on the fly. By default the result is returned as a
base matrix or vector; alternatively, supply a writer via \code{into} to stream
the output elsewhere (e.g., \code{hdf5_writer()}).
